## Posture
I'm concerned with building the theories, methods, systems, and tooling to reform, redesign, or replace institutions where power has become entrenched, extractive, or unaccountable. Modern socio-technical systems routinely extract time, labor, attention, capital, and identity under manufactured consent. I study and design alternatives.

My work is oriented toward:
- Legitimacy of power  
- Removability of authority  
- Real exit without catastrophic loss  
- Transparent extraction boundaries  
- Non-manipulated information flows  
- Durable collective self-determination  

## Philosophy of Engineering

Power must be:
- Inspectable (visible)
- Contestable (challengeable)
- Removable (deposable)
- Bounded (limited)
- Accountable (consequence-bearing)

If a system cannot survive those tests, it is not legitimate.

Software is not neutral. Infrastructure encodes governance.  
This profile documents experiments in building systems that preserve agency rather than erode it.

## Active Projects

- **PSID Canon Formation**
- **ALI Method Expansion**
- **ALIAS Audit Architecture**
- **HackStack (platformized liberatory tooling)**

More to come as theory becomes infrastructure.<br>
If you're building governance-aware systems, designing post-extractive infrastructure, or interested in durable socio-technical reconstruction, do reach out.
